# Ontology Lookup

**Ontology Lookup** is a command-line tool and Python package that interacts with the [Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) API](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/docs/api) to fetch details about a specific ontology. Given an ontology ID, it returns details such as the title, description, number of terms, and status.

## Features

- Retrieves ontology information by ontology ID
- Displays ontology title, description, term count, and status
- Command-line interface (CLI) for easy access
- Extensible design for further development and integration

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `requests` library (installable via `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/ontology_lookup.git
cd ontology_lookup
```

### Install Dependencies
It’s recommended to use a virtual environment. Install dependencies using requirements.txt:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Alternatively, you can install the package in editable mode (to directly use the package’s dependencies specified in setup.py):
```bash
pip install -e .
```
## Usage
The ontology_lookup package can be used as a command-line tool. Provide an ontology ID to retrieve information about the ontology.

Command-Line Usage
After installation, you can use the command-line tool ontology-lookup as follows:
```bash
ontology-lookup <ontology_id>
```
### Example
```bash
ontology-lookup efo
```
### Output:
```yaml
Ontology Details:
  Title: Experimental Factor Ontology
  Description: An ontology for experimental variables in the biomedical domain.
  Number of Terms: 12345
  Status: Production
```

## Library Usage
You can also use ontology_lookup programmatically in your Python code.

```python
from ontology_lookup.main import OntologyService
# Create an instance of OntologyService with an ontology ID
service = OntologyService("efo")

# Fetch ontology details
details = service.fetch_ontology_details()
print(details)
```
